Memory Model
============

cuTile employs a memory model that permits the compiler and hardware to reorder operations for performance.
As a result, without explicit synchronization, there is no guaranteed ordering of memory accesses across threads.

To coordinate memory accesses among threads, cuTile provides two attributes for atomic operations:

*   **Memory Order**: Defines the memory ordering semantics of an atomic operation.
*   **Memory Scope**: Defines the scope of threads that participate in memory ordering.

Synchronization occurs at a per-element granularity. Each element in the array participates independently in the memory model.

For a more detailed explanation, see the Memory Model section in the `Tile IR documentation <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/tile-ir/>`_.
